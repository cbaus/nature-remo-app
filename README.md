Basic Android app for Nature Remo 3
## Introduction
Kotlin-based smartphone app for home automation with Nature Remo. Developed for Nature Remo 3 but should work for other models that access the API in the same way.
I developed it because I want access to temperature and humidity values that are not available on the normal app.

## Outlook
Ideally this app should not work via the cloud API but the local API. Right now the local API is not well supported by Nature. I can't change it right now.
